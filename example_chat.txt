You: which one I should go with cream or crunchy

ShopGPT: The decision between creamy and crunchy peanut butter ultimately depends on your personal preference. If you prefer a smooth and spreadable texture, then creamy peanut butter would be the better choice for you. On the other hand, if you enjoy the added crunch and texture of small peanut pieces, then crunchy peanut butter would be more suitable. Consider your preferred taste and texture when making your decision.
